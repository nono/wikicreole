** bold at at start of file **

**bold**, //italics//, __underline__, ^^superscript^^, __subscript__, 
and ##monospace## all work the same way.

// italics at start of paragraph //

a paragraph with 
## monospace in the middle ##
with more after

__ underline with
no closing 
markup

* ,, subscript as first list item,
continued on second line ,,

* first list item
* ^^ superscript as second item, no closing tag
* with more to come

= heading ** with bold **, which is redundant but possible
== heading // with italics // is not redundant


| here's a table | with // italics in it
| second row ^^ squared ^^ | etcetera

here's a [[ link | link //** with bold italics **// in it ]].  
here's some __// ** bold ** inside italics // and underlined __.  
here's what happens when you don't mix ** bold and // italics ** // properly.  
don't try it in {{{ __ inline nowiki __ }}}, but feel free to put it
## // inside monospace // ##.  

{{{
no point in trying to put ^^ superscript ^^ inside nowiki blocks either
}}}

: should also be able to put ** bold ^^ and superscript ^^ ** in an
indented paragraph

; how 'bout  **__ Underlined bold __** in a definition list?
: not to mention, the actual // italicized definition //

* first item
## ## monospace ** with bold ** as first subitem in numbered list ##
*** another sublist after // with italics //
