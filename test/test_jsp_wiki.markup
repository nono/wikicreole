You can make things **strong** or //em// or **//both//** or //**both**//.

Character formatting extends across line breaks: **strong,
this is still strong. This line deliberately does not end in star-star.

Not strong. Character formatting does not cross paragraph boundaries.

Creole1.0 specifies that http://bar and ftp://bar should not render italic,
something like foo://bar should render as italic.

You can use this to draw a line to separate the page:
----

You can use lists, start it at the first column for now, please...

unnumbered lists are like
* item a
* item b
* **bold item c**

blank space is also permitted before lists like:
  *   item a
 * item b
* item c
 ** item c.a
 
 or you can number them
# [[item 1]]
# item 2
# // italic item 3 //
    ## item 3.1
  ## item 3.2
  
up to five levels
* 1
** 2
*** 3
**** 4
***** 5

* You can have
multiline list items
* this is a second multiline
list item

You can use nowiki syntax if you would like do stuff like this:

{{{
Guitar Chord C:

||---|---|---|
||-1-|---|---|
||---|---|---|
||---|-2-|---|
||---|---|-3-|
||---|---|---|
}}}

You can also use it inline nowiki {{{ in a sentence }}} like this.

= Escapes =
Normal Link: http://wikicreole.org - now same link, but escaped: http:~//wikicreole.org

Normal asterisks: ~**not bold~**

a tilde alone: ~

a tilde escapes itself: ~~xxx

Tables are done like this:

|=header col1|=header col2| 
|col1|col2| 
|you         |can         | 
|also        |align\\ it. |

You can format an address by simply forcing linebreaks:

My contact dates:\\
Pone: xyz\\
Fax: +45\\
Mobile: abc

|= Header title               |= Another header title     |
| {{{ //not italic text// }}} | {{{ **not bold text** }}} |
| //italic text//             | **  bold text **          |
